# 🚀 VidSage AI – Chat with YouTube Videos

> Turn any YouTube video into an AI-powered assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

---

## 🧠 Overview

VidSage AI allows users to input a YouTube video ID and interact with its content using natural language.

Instead of watching long videos, users can:
- 💬 Ask questions
- ⚡ Get instant answers
- 🧾 Understand content quickly

The system uses a RAG pipeline to ensure answers are accurate and based only on the video content.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Input any YouTube Video ID  
- 🧾 Automatic transcript extraction  
- ✂️ Smart text chunking  
- 🧠 Semantic search using embeddings  
- 💬 Chat interface like ChatGPT  
- 🔒 Answers strictly based on video transcript  
- ⚡ Fast and relevant responses

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔹 Step 1: Indexing (Video Processing)

1. User enters YouTube Video ID  
2. Backend fetches transcript  
3. Transcript is converted into a document  
4. Document is split into smaller chunks  
5. Each chunk is converted into embeddings  
6. Stored in ChromaDB  

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Retrieval (Question Answering)

1. User asks a question  
2. Question is converted into embedding  
3. Retriever finds most relevant chunks  
4. Context + Question is sent to LLM  
5. LLM generates final answer
